        <div class="question">Hey! How come I can't see NYT reviews or create a personal movie list?
            You lied to me!</div>
        <div class="answer">
            These features are for registered users only. Ideally, they would be available to
            all, but due to NYT's API request limit and my desire to avoid maintaining an 
            ever-growing database of users, I've limited access to these features to a small group of people.

        <div class="question">Can you create a user account for me?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            If I know you and like you, sure! Just get in touch. Otherwise, probably not.

        <div class="question">I'm a registered user, and I've noticed that it's often slower to
            pull up movie info when I'm logged in than when I'm not. Are you warping time or 
            is something else going on here?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            NYT's API has a max request limit of 10 requests per minute, so I have to delay certain 
            API calls by six seconds. For some movies, it may take several calls to search for a 
            review, resulting in longer wait times. I have a design fix to reduce the wait time 
            for movie info, which I hope implement in the future.

        <div class="question">Ouch. Among other unpleasant things I saw in your codebase,
            I found a security vulnerability. Should I hack you or tell you?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Please tell me! I'd really appreciate it. If you are so inclined, 
            you can fork the project and make a pull request. I will gladly review your changes.

        <div class="question">
            Why should I even bother to use this site? IMDB and TMDB do the same things and more.
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Indeed they do, and I'm especially impressed with
            <a class=text-info href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">TMDB</a>. 
            <div>Don't use Cinescout if you don't want
            to â€” it's a personal project that I've decided to share with the world, nothing more. 
            That said, you can always trust that you will never have to suffer ads or tracking 
            cookies on Cinescout; it's my intent to keep the interface simple and uncluttered.</div>
