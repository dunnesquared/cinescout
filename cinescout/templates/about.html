        <div class="question">Hey! How come I can't see NYT reviews or create a personal movie list?
            You lied to me!</div>
        <div class="answer">
            These features are for registered users only. Ideally, they would be available to
            all, but due to NYT's API request limit and my desire to avoid maintaining an 
            ever-growing database of users, I've limited access to these features to a small group of people.

        <div class="question">Can you create a user account for me?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            If I know you and like you, sure! Just get in touch. Otherwise, probably not.

        <div class="question">I'm a registered user. I've noticed that while most movie reviews 
            appear instantaneously, others take more time to display. Why?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            NYT's API has a max request limit of 10 requests per minute, so I have to delay each 
            API call by several seconds. For some movies, it may take a few calls to search for a 
            review, resulting in longer wait times. Other movie info will appear relatively faster,
            however, as calls to the NYT API are done asynchronously.

        <div class="question">Ouch. Among other unpleasant things I saw in your codebase,
            I found a security vulnerability. Should I hack you or tell you?</div>
        <div class="answer">
            Please tell me! I'd really appreciate it. If you are so inclined, 
            you can fork the project and make a pull request. I will gladly review your changes.

        <div class="question">
            Why should I even bother to use this site? IMDB and TMDB do the same things and more.
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            Indeed they do, and I'm especially impressed with
            <a class=text-info href="https://www.themoviedb.org/">TMDB</a>. 
            <div>Don't use Cinescout if you don't want
            to â€” it's a personal project that I've decided to share with the world, nothing more. 
            That said, you can always trust that you will never have to suffer ads or tracking 
            cookies on Cinescout; it's my intent to keep the interface simple and uncluttered.</div>
